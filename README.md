## About

A browser version of etch-a-sketch sketchpad demonstrated mainly using DOM manipulation and event listeners.

Move MouseOver (hidden grid) inside the sketch pad (red frame) to scribble.

Color of sketch for each grid-square will be a random RGB value except its initial color.

Press Reset button to change no. of squares per side for grid and enter a value between 16 to 100 in prompt. After submitting the value, the existing grid is removed (erasing the doodle made in process), and is replaced with new grid.
